Short list of features I plan to add to SPTF

 * Support for Win32
 * Support for class + method execution style in other languages (Ruby, Python, etc).
 * Replace Metadata format (YAML) with other format. Probably using Config:Std.
 * Database to archive test results.
 * 'quiet' option for the test session. No test results goes to the output. Only return code.
 * Configurable timeout for each test case.
 * Configurable option to execute additional operation when test failed. (on_failure tag)
 * Coverage. New tag in metadata - feature. I assume, running all tests with given feature will give 100% coverage for this feature.
 *
